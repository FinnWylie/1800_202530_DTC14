# Trip 'n Dip

## Overview

Trip 'n Dip is a client-side JavaScript web application that helps users discover and explore places to visit. The app displays a curated list of sight-seeing areas, each with details such as name, location, and an image. Users can browse the list and mark places for easy access later.
